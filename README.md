# EC_assignment_1_EvoMan
Assignment 1 of the course "Evolutionary Computing" requires us to train a specialist agent for the game "EvoMan", using several Evolutionary Algorithms.  

Task: Implement two Evolutionary Algorithms that use the simulation mode “Individual evolution” of the framework to train a specialist agent.

How: Use 3 enemies (games) to experiment with your algorithms. For each enemy, make an independent experiment evolving an specialist agent, and for all cases use exactly the same algorithm parameters. You are allowed, but not required, to use the code of the neural network (demo_controller.py) available in the scripts of demonstration.
